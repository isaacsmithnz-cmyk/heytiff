# HeyTiff design

The scales, the laws, and the numbers that hold them. Read this before touching
a stylesheet or anything a person sees. Written 2026-09-10 after an audit of
`src` on main `c02be59` against the catalogue of tells that mark an app as
generated (the research and the audit are linked at the end).

## Why this file exists

The app converged on the generic look by inheritance, not by choice. The v3
Figma shell was ported verbatim, and every screen since inherited its dress:
the 24px card with the icon in a tinted square, the tracked-caps eyebrow over a
38px title, the staggered page entrance, weight 800 for everything, and a frame
lit by roaming orbs. Later screens did not fix that; each grew its own dress
instead, and the stylesheets now hold twenty-five class-prefix families with
thirteen radii and seventy-nine type sizes between them.

The laws that kept some of this out lived in comments and in one assistant's
notes. Neither is read by the next tool that draws a screen. This file is.
Every decision below is made once, here, and a guard test holds each number.

## Decisions taken 2026-09-10

- **The shell is still.** The dark frame, the rail, the bar and the light well
  stay exactly where they are. The aurora blobs, the rising orbs, the corner
  glow and the active item's glow go. The only light is the content well.
- **One accent.** Teal does four jobs: the brand mark, the focus ring, the
  primary action, selection. Blue and violet leave the interface palette. The
  avatar ring is a hairline; the status dot is gone until presence means
  something. Open: whether orange remains the Studio's drawing colour on the
  canvas. It is not a UI accent either way.
- **Icons are drawn in the chevron's language**, in house, most-used first: a
  7% stroke (1.7 on a 24 grid), butt caps, round joins, and one stroke at 55%
  for the detail or the motion. The Lucide paths in `shell/icon.tsx` are what
  they replace.
- **No texture.** Grain and paper noise are the third generated look. The paper
  idea comes from structure and type.
- **HQ stays as it is.** Its KPI tiles are not user-facing. Not in scope.
- **The job sheet is parked.** A ruled-list job sheet reads as paper but scans
  worse than the row. Nothing in that direction moves until a version keeps the
  row's scannability.

## Scales

A screen picks a role. It never picks a number.

| Radius | Role |
|---|---|
| 6px | control: input, chip, checkbox |
| 10px | button, tile |
| 16px | card, panel, sheet |
| 999px | pill |
| 50% | circle: avatar, dot |

| Type | Weight | Role |
|---|---|---|
| 12px | 500 | caption, the floor; nothing is set smaller |
| 13px | 500 | label, table cell |
| 14px | 400 | body |
| 16px | 600 | heading in a card or section |
| 20px | 600 | screen section title |
| 24px | 700 | screen title |
| 32px | 700 | display, one per screen at most |
| 40px | 700 | display, the sheet and the door only |

Weight 800 is retired. Figures that line up in columns take
`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` and carry their unit.

| Surface | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| ground | `#F0F2F5` | the page |
| surface | `#fff` | anything that holds content |
| line | `rgba(5,5,5,.08)` | the one hairline; a raised thing is surface plus line |
| overlay | `0 12px 32px rgba(10,12,20,.16)` | the one shadow, only for a thing that floats over the page |

A box is one of three things. A **card** is something you act on: surface,
line, 16px. A **group** is something you read: no box, a hairline top. An
**overlay** floats: surface and the one shadow. A fourth kind is a question for
this file, not a new class prefix.

| Accent and state | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| teal | `#00E5C0`, `#00A389` on a light ground | brand mark, focus ring, primary action, selection |
| ok | `#00735f` text, `#00A389` chip | state |
| warn | `#a44b08` text, `#F0A431` chip | state |
| bad | `#c81a41` text, `#e0264f` chip | state |
| info | `#2554d8` text | state |

State is never the page accent, and the accent is never a state.

## Laws

Most of these were already practice. They are written down so the next tool
starts with them.

1. A segmented tray is a fill or an edge, never the ground's own value.
2. State colour is never the page accent.
3. No hint text. A caption that excuses a design which did not explain itself
   is a design bug; fix the design.
4. No mono face. Jakarta only.
5. No AI badge, no sparkle, no feature named after the technology. A feature is
   named after what it does with the data.
6. No emoji as an icon.
7. Desktop first. A phone-width finding is unbuilt surface, not a defect.
8. Motion is feedback or state. Under 300 ms, ease-out on entry, none on
   keyboard-driven or high-frequency actions, and never ambient. A page
   appears; it does not arrive.
9. A card is for something you act on. Everything else is grouped by space,
   proximity and type.
10. The eyebrow is retired. A title stands alone; what the eyebrow said goes
    under it in sentence case, body size, the quiet colour, with real figures.
11. No hero inside the app. The title line and the facts.
12. Copy: sentence case everywhere; a button is a verb and a noun; success is
    noun plus verb, never "successfully"; no exclamation marks; no apology; an
    empty state leads with the action; a wait says what it is doing.
13. Real content from the first day: long names, truncation, every state.
14. No bar at the start. A coloured line down the left edge of a row, card,
    tile or nav item is not a state and not a selection. Selection is a fill.
    State is a word, or a dot, in the state colour. Kind is a label. The nav's
    active item is its teal icon and its white label, nothing else.
15. No taglines, and no caption that explains the section. The two shapes:
    three nouns in a row under a title ("splits, ducted, multi") and a line
    that says what the section is for ("What lets the business trade —
    nothing expiring"). The title names the section; the content shows what
    it is for. A line under a title earns its place only when it carries a
    fact the reader came for, with a figure, a date or a name. "3 need
    attention" is that fact. "Nothing expiring" is the same fact as
    reassurance, and "What lets the business trade" is an explanation. Keep
    the fact, drop the rest.

## Guards

`src/app/dashboard/__tests__/design-ratchets.test.ts` counts eight things
across every screen stylesheet under `src` and holds each count at the number
recorded there. A PR may lower a number. A PR may never raise one. When a
count drops, the PR lowers the recorded number with it, so the number is
always the truth. Every guard was watched failing before it was trusted.

The three paper stylesheets are outside the guards on purpose: the design
sheet (`sheet-doc.css`), the letterhead and the live sheet are documents set
for print, with their own type.

| Ratchet | Law | 2026-09-10 |
|---|---|---|
| type below 12px | the floor | 545 |
| weight 800 or 900 | retired | 625 |
| `transition: all` | transitions name what moves | 96 |
| `text-transform: uppercase` | the eyebrow is retired | 202 |
| radius off the scale | four radii and a circle | 748 |
| ambient `infinite` animation | motion is feedback or state | 45 |
| gradients | one accent, flat surfaces | 136 |
| shadows that are not a focus ring | one shadow, overlays only | 291 |
| bars at the left edge | selection is a fill, state is a word | 27 |

The end state for each is zero, or a short allowlist with a reason beside each
entry (a spinner is state; the orb breathing with the microphone is feedback).

## The order of work

1. **The shell**, still. Decided.
2. **This file and the guards.** No pixels change.
3. **Tokens before screens.** The scales above become custom properties on
   `:root`; the stylesheets are migrated to them mechanically; the four daily
   screens are walked. The only step that touches every family at once.
4. **The inherited tells**, one walked PR each: the orbs, the card and its
   icon square, the eyebrows, the stagger and shimmer and spotlight, the
   hero on My Vehicle. Then the two Isaac named on 2026-09-10: the bars at the
   left edge (33 places on that day, eleven of them in the Workboard, seven in
   the Toolbox) and the taglines and section captions (the list is in the
   step 2 PR).
5. **The icons.**
6. **Fold the dress families into the tokens**, one per PR, deleting dead CSS as
   you go. By rule count: `wb2-` 1,316 · `ds-` 325 · `hq-` 287 · `tk-` 281 ·
   `hm-` 265 · `vm-` 245 · `fl-` 203 · `mts2-` 155 · `dsd-` 129 · `wb-` 102 ·
   the rest. The v3 Studio glass chrome in `shell.css` (`.fg .dhead`,
   `.dtools`, `.dstatus`, `.dprops`, `.dview`, `.dread`) has no consumer and
   goes first. Target: both big stylesheets halved.
7. **The paper.** Parked, see above.

Walking means merging, because previews cannot sign in, and a deploy reloads
open tabs, so nothing merges while Isaac is designing. Batch by step, walk each
step in one sitting.

## What stays because it is already ours

No component kit: the app is hand-written CSS with Tailwind imported and barely
used. One typeface. Real focus rings. No AI badge. And the copy: no exclamation
marks, no "Oops", no "successfully", no "Are you sure", empty states written in
the trade ("Nothing claimed yet — the deposit is usually the first row"), and a
wait that says what it is doing. That is the app's strongest signature. Guard it
as hard as the rest.
